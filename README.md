# PlasmaWallpaper_CityGrow
Plasma Wallpaper Plugin (also Screen Lock) with growing city animation

Simple animation which looks like growing cities. This was inspired from an old KDE3 wallpaper (sorry, I cannot remember the name). Also, I used the Game of Life wallpaper plugin as "tutorial" (thanks to user @jaapgeurts).
